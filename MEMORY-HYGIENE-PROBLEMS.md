# Memory system — measured problems, 2026-08-25

Evidence base for the remediation work. Every number here was measured, not
estimated. Main store is `~/.claude/projects/-Users-adityasamalla-repos/memory`
(218 memories); there are 8 stores totalling 289 memories.

## Problems

1. **The index exceeds its load limit and structurally cannot comply.**
   219 lines against a 200-line limit (second limit ~25,000 chars; currently
   23.5KB, under). 218 memories, one line each. Past either limit the tail is
   dropped silently at session start. Shortening hooks only relieves the
   CHARACTER limit — the LINE limit needs fewer entries.

2. **6% of wiki-links are broken** — 35 of 588 do not resolve to a file.

3. **Root cause of most of those: 64 of 218 memories have a hyphenated `name:`
   while the filename uses underscores.** `[[feedback-bash-allowlist-prefix-matching]]`
   never resolves to `feedback_bash_allowlist_prefix_matching.md`.

4. **`verify:` coverage is 6%** — 14 of 218. The other 204 cannot be checked
   mechanically at all.

5. **87 of 218 memories have no `metadata.modified` stamp**, so age falls back
   to file mtime, which moves whenever anything rewrites the file. "How long has
   this claim been wrong" becomes unanswerable.

6. **Index hooks drift from the memories they summarise.** Two confirmed, both
   with the SUMMARY lagging the BODY:
   - index line `3 PRs open (#1938 #1608 #29)` while the linked memory said
     "all MERGED 2026-08-25" — and that hook sits in the ACTIVE-WORK block, the
     most-read line in the file.
   - a memory `description` saying a PR was "still open and unreviewed" while
     line 33 of its own body said "MERGED".

7. **Long-lived memories decay into false claims.** One 56KB memory (94 very
   long lines) is ~63% a per-repo shipping ledger; two entries still read
   "IN PROGRESS: PR open" while the top of the same file records both merged.

8. **Staleness detection has a timing gap.** Unverified open-state claims are
   triaged only after 14 days, but PR-state claims rot in hours — one memory
   asserted PRs open that had merged the same day it was written.

9. **Cross-store fragmentation.** A memory about repo X lives in whichever store
   the session was launched from, so a store-scoped audit misses it.

## Measured NOT to be a problem

**Content duplication is ~zero.** Of 1,328 distinct bolded claims across the
corpus, only 6 appeared in more than one memory, and 5 of those were a single
pair (since deduplicated, −1,126 bytes). The corpus is genuinely non-redundant,
so **compaction cannot reclaim index lines**.

## Heuristics built and WITHDRAWN — do not re-propose without addressing why

- **"Retire settled memories with no lesson-shaped wording."** Flagged a memory
  recording a verified pipeline MISMATCH (a real bug) and one recording that a
  table is absent from the lakehouse so a conversion is blocked. Both are
  durable FACTS containing no lesson words. No wordlist separates a pure status
  record from a durable fact.
- **"Merge memories that are about the same ticket."** Grouped a 21-hour
  production crash-loop with a PR-landing table because both cited INS-581.
  Verbatim-claim overlap was 4 for the one real pair and 0 for all three
  others — content overlap separates them, ticket key does not.

Standing principle: deleting on a heuristic destroys knowledge silently, which
is strictly worse than staleness. The tool reports; a human decides.

## Better rule, derived during the audit

For completed work, **keep the technique and the mechanism facts, drop the
ledger** — a section-level rule, not a file-level one. File-level tests keep
failing because a single memory mixes disposable status with durable fact.

## Fixes already applied

- 4 memories corrected against live GitHub/Jira (INS-449, INS-431, INS-430/423,
  ANEP-5121 blocker cleared); 14 now carry `verify:` blocks; 23 claims verify
  mechanically.
- Index hook `3 PRs open` → `ALL MERGED 08-25`.
- `models-ci-optimization-ins499` description and `INS-552 = IN PROGRESS` line
  corrected — both tickets Done (INS-499 08-24, INS-552 08-25).
- `project_psp4340_...` now records Hongxuan's 2026-08-21 confirmation that the
  payload carries `INSTANCE_ID` and the fault is a deployment issue; the
  unanswered long-term-ownership question is flagged as the only thing left.
- 5 verbatim-duplicated lessons stripped from the INS-430/431 summary.

# Review findings and remediation, 2026-08-25

Fable reviewed the enumeration above. Its two sharpest points, both verified:

**Problem 6 is a normalization problem, not a detection one.** State lives in
three places — index hook, frontmatter `description`, body — so any volatile
claim drifts by construction. No mechanical check can fix that. Summaries must
become state-free retrieval cues, with volatile state in exactly one place next
to a `verify:` block. Then the drift class ceases to exist.

**Problem 1 was being measured against the wrong thing.** The limit was never
the harm; the ORDERING was. Truncation is tail-first and the index was in pure
append order, so it dropped the NEWEST entries. Measured live: 19 entries past
the cut, **5 of them `feedback_` memories** — the behaviour-shaping ones, which
are worthless unless loaded. Fixed first.

## Corrections to the numbers above

- **"35 broken wiki-links" was inflated.** 26 were mechanically repairable, 7
  were links to memories not yet written — which the memory format treats as a
  marker for something worth writing, not an error — and 1 was `[[:space:]]`, a
  POSIX character class quoted in a body and matching the wiki-link shape.
- **"87 missing `modified`" is now 88, and only 42 were safely fixable.** The
  other 46 have an mtime of today because tooling touched them, so mtime no
  longer carries information about when the CLAIM last changed.
- **13 memories across 4 stores have no `metadata:` block at all** — old-format
  files predating the convention. Not previously counted.
- **Cross-store fragmentation (#9) is latent, not active.** 5 worktree-slug
  project dirs exist but none has a `memory/` subdir, so nothing has been
  written into one yet.

## Rules learned while fixing

- **Never stamp a date you cannot source.** Backfilling `modified` with today
  fabricates recency and hides a memory from age-gated triage, which is worse
  than no stamp. When the true date is unrecoverable, leave it unstamped.
- **Snapshot mtimes before editing anything.** Otherwise pass 1 bumps 64 files
  and pass 3 records today for all of them — the age signal is destroyed
  corpus-wide in a single run. This nearly happened.
- **A finding queue with mixed meanings gets ignored.** `memory-fix` initially
  counted ambiguous links, missing `name:`, and missing `metadata:` in one
  counter, so 13 malformed memories were reported as "ambiguous links" and then
  masked entirely by a later guard. Same defect Fable flagged in
  `memory-verify`'s overloaded `SKIP`.
- **Repair the frontmatter, never rename the file.** 560 links already resolve
  against filenames; renaming to match `name:` would break the working majority
  to fix the broken few.

## Status

| phase | state |
|---|---|
| 0 · git-init the stores | DONE — 8 stores, 298 files baselined |
| 1 · tier-order the index | DONE — pure permutation, 0 feedback below the cut |
| 2 · `bin/memory-fix.sh` | DONE — 178 repairs on the main store, 45 tests |
| 3 · generate index from frontmatter | pending |
| 4 · liveness triage at age zero | DONE — un-gated; caught a real drift the same day |
| 5 · demote settled projects to ARCHIVE.md | measured, not built — see below |
| 6 · write-time lint hook | DONE — `hooks/memory-lint.sh`, 25 tests, deployed |

Evidence that phases 3 and 6 are both needed: a memory written by the live
system DURING this session arrived with no `modified:` stamp and a 176-char
index line appended blindly to the end of the file — past the truncation cut,
in the section reserved for a different type.

## Correction: nothing clips an index line on the way in

The review said the injected copy clips lines at ~115 chars and that a previous
char-limit fix had hard-clipped hooks in the file. Checked against this
session's own injected index: the line

    - [BATCH_METADATA carries cypher timings](...) — per-policy ms ALREADY

is 109 characters and arrived **byte-identical** to the file. There is no
injection-side per-line clipping. The mid-clause hooks are an authoring
artifact - hooks were hand-clipped to a ~110 char budget when written, and the
corpus shows it: median 106 chars, p90 110, and only 6 of 220 lines above it.

The budget is still worth enforcing, for a different reason than assumed. The
index as a whole has a ~25,000 character limit, and at one line per memory the
per-line length is the only lever on it: 220 x 110 = 24,200, already at the
edge. So compose hooks to the budget - but because of the total, not because
anything truncates a single line.

## Archival cannot fix the index size either

Evidence gathered live from Jira for all 125 ticket keys cited by project
memories. Applying the rule "every cited ticket terminal AND no open-state
language in the body":

| | count |
|---|---|
| provably settled | **3** |
| asserts open state in the body | 21 |
| cites an unresolved or non-existent ticket | 32 |

So demotion sheds **3** index lines, against the ~27 needed. **The corpus is
mostly live work**, which is the same shape as the duplication finding: neither
compaction nor archival can bring this index under 200, because the memories are
neither redundant nor finished.

Two things follow. First, tier-ordering is not a stopgap before the real fix —
it *is* the fix, because managed truncation of the cheapest tail is the only
lever that actually exists. Second, 40 of the 60 ANEP keys no longer resolve in
Jira at all, so a large slice of older project memories can never be proven
settled; their evidence is gone. An archival tool would be correct but would
have very little to do, which is why it was measured rather than built.

Verify blocks recording the live Jira evidence were written for the 3.

## A measurement bug worth remembering

The first run of this analysis reported **13** settled, not 3. The Bash tool's
shell is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted expansions, so `for k in $keys`
iterated once over the whole multi-line string; `grep "^$k"` then treated the
embedded newlines as pattern alternatives, matched every key at once, and the
"is it terminal?" test passed because one of the concatenated statuses was
`Done`. **The wrong answer had exactly the shape of the right one.** Saved as
`reference_bash_tool_runs_zsh_no_word_split`.
