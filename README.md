# Claude Code Harness

Machine-level security, audit, and context hooks for Claude Code.
Install once per developer machine — works across all projects without touching repo files.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aditya-samalla/claude-code-harness.git
cd claude-code-harness
bash install.sh
```

The installer:
- Merges into any existing `~/.claude/settings.json` (user keys preserved, allow/deny lists unioned, hooks owned by harness).
- Backs up the previous file as `settings.json.bak.<timestamp>`.
- Runs `doctor.sh` to verify every hook after install.

Then open Claude Code and run `/hooks` to confirm everything is registered.

## What it does

### Security — hard block (`deny`)

| Hook | Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `env-guard` | PreToolUse → Bash | Blocks commands that read, dump, copy, or exfiltrate env values or dotfiles (`cat .env`, `printenv`, `echo $API_KEY`, `cp .env /tmp/x`, `dd if=.env`, `… < .env`, `curl --data @creds`, `nc`, `eval $(env)`, etc.) |
| `sensitive-file-guard` | PreToolUse → Read/Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit | Blocks access to `*.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, SSH keys, AWS creds, `.npmrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.pgpass`, `.kube/config`, `.ssh/config`, `.docker/config.json`, `credentials.json`, service-account JSON. Resolves symlinks so a symlinked path can't bypass. |
| `git-guard` | PreToolUse → Bash | Denies force-push, `.git/hooks` writes, `core.hooksPath` tampering (including via `-c`), shell-body (`!`) aliases, `filter-branch`, broad `git add`. Normalizes `git -c k=v` / `-C dir` global-option prefixes so they can't break the match. |
| `interpreter-guard` | PreToolUse → Bash | Denies `python -c` / `node -e` / `ruby -e` / `perl -ne` / `php -r` / `bash -c` and heredocs when the payload references env vars, dotfiles, sockets, or subprocess APIs — including when wrapped in a command runner (`poetry run`, `env`, `timeout`, `nohup`, …). Raises the bar on the interpreter-bypass route — but string-obfuscated payloads can still evade a regex; the OS sandbox is the real containment. |
| `network-guard` | PreToolUse → Bash, WebFetch | Denies file-body uploads via `curl -d @…` / `-d@…` / `--data=@…`, `-F @…`, `-T`, **and pipe-to-shell remote code execution** (piping curl/wget into a shell or interpreter, process substitution, or command substitution). Prompts on `scp`/`rsync`/`sftp` to a remote host and on local HTTP servers. |
| `secret-scanner` | PreToolUse → Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit | Scans the payload before it hits disk; denies AWS keys, JWTs, PEM blocks, GitHub/Slack(token+webhook)/Stripe/Google/Anthropic/OpenAI(incl. `sk-proj-`) tokens and GCP service-account keys |

### Security — prompt user (`ask`)

> Under the shipped `defaultMode: auto`, these prompts are resolved by the auto-mode
> classifier rather than by you. See [Auto mode](#auto-mode).

| Hook | Triggers |
|---|---|
| `git-guard` | `git push --delete`, `git push origin :branch`, `git remote set-url`, `git config user.email`, non-shell `git config alias.*`, glob staging (`git add '*.ts'`) |
| `interpreter-guard` | Long inline scripts with no obvious sensitive token |
| `kubectl-guard` | Every mutating `kubectl` verb (`delete`, `apply`, `patch`, `replace`, `edit`, `scale`, `drain`, `cordon`, `taint`, `exec`, `cp`, `run`, `debug`, `proxy`, `rollout undo/restart`, `auth reconcile`, `config use-context`, …) wherever the verb sits in the command, plus `get secret` (credential materialisation) and any subcommand on neither list (fails closed). Exists because `kubectl` takes its global flags **before** the verb, so a prefix-matched rule like `Bash(kubectl delete:*)` misses `kubectl --namespace vm delete pod foo` — no allow/deny pair in `settings.json` can express this. Escalates rather than blocks: auto mode ships ~10 kubectl-specific `soft_deny` rules that clear when you name the target, and a hook `deny` would preempt all of them. Read-only verbs (`get`, `describe`, `logs`, `top`, `port-forward`, `rollout status`, `auth can-i`, `config view`, …) pass silently; flag *values* are skipped so `--context delete-me get pods` is still a read. |
| `network-guard` | `curl -X POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE` (any host), `curl`/`wget`/`WebFetch` to non-allowlisted domain |

### Audit (async, non-blocking)

| Hook | Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `audit` | PostToolUse → Edit/Write | Logs every file Claude touches |
| `audit` | PostToolUse → Bash | Logs every Bash command Claude runs (sanitized to one line) |
| `audit` | PostToolUseFailure | Logs failed tool calls with error summary |
| `audit` | ConfigChange | Logs any settings file modified mid-session |
| `audit` | SessionEnd | Logs a session-end line **once per session** — turn count (derived from the transcript; cost isn't exposed to hooks), session id, and why the session ended (`clear` / `logout` / `exit`). Previously wired to `Stop`, which fires at *every* turn end and so wrote a mislabelled `session_end` line per turn. The hook still accepts `Stop` if you rewire it. |

All entries go to `~/.claude/logs/audit.log` (`0600` perms, rotated at 10 MB, 5 backups retained).

### Context & continuity

| Hook | Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `session-start` | SessionStart | Injects git branch, status, and last 5 commits into context automatically. On `source=resume`, also diffs each file the prior session edited against a content-hash snapshot and surfaces any drift (file reverted, missing, or HEAD moved) so Claude re-verifies before trusting the prior transcript's narrative. |
| `session-snapshot` | Stop | Records the hashes of every file the session edited, plus `git HEAD`, to `~/.claude/state/sessions/<session_id>.json` (0600, keeps newest 50). Feeds the resume-drift check above. |
| `pre-compact` | PreCompact | Backs up the full session transcript before compaction. Keeps last 20. |
| `notify` | Notification | Desktop alert when Claude needs input (async) |

### Readability

| Hook | Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow-record` | PostToolUse → Workflow | Logs each workflow run's persisted `.js` script path to the audit log and records a per-session pointer the status line links to. Clicking the `wf` link opens the script in your editor (auto-detects VS Code / Cursor / Zed; override with `CLAUDE_EDITOR_URI`). Discoverability only — no rendering. |
| `plan-to-html` | PreToolUse → ExitPlanMode | Renders the proposed plan as a styled HTML file and opens it in your browser, so long plans are comfortable to read before you approve/reject in the terminal. (The page loads `marked`/`highlight.js` from a CDN for rendering and gracefully falls back to readable raw markdown when offline — it is not fully self-contained.) Runs `async` — never blocks or delays the approval prompt. Markdown is base64-embedded (no escaping can break the page) and decoded as UTF-8 client-side via [marked](https://marked.js.org/) and rendered with a GitHub-dark theme plus [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) syntax highlighting for fenced code; falls back to readable raw markdown when offline. Plans authored as a **full HTML document** are served verbatim (no double-wrap). Output lands in `~/.claude/plans-html/` (newest 50 kept), and the session's latest plan is linked from the **status line** as a clickable OSC-8 hyperlink. |

### Settings shipped

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `permissions.defaultMode` | `auto` | Every session starts in **auto mode** — a model classifier adjudicates permission prompts instead of stopping for a keystroke. See [Auto mode](#auto-mode) for what this changes about the guards. |
| `fileCheckpointingEnabled` | `true` | Snapshots files before edits so `/rewind` can restore them |
| `effortLevel` | `xhigh` | Default reasoning effort (portable across machines) |
| `skipAutoPermissionPrompt` | `true` | Pre-accepts the auto-mode opt-in dialog, so auto mode is live on first launch rather than waiting behind a dialog |
| `sandbox` | off by default | OS sandbox (Seatbelt/bubblewrap) drafted with a read-only network allowlist (npm/pypi/crates/go/github/anthropic). Flip `sandbox.enabled` to `true` to confine commands. See Customization. |
| `includeCoAuthoredBy` | `true` | Adds `Co-authored-by: Claude` to commits |
| `permissions.allow` | Scoped allowlist (≈83 entries) | Covers common safe ops: `npm test/run lint/build`, `pytest`, `python3`, `poetry run/install/lock`, `gh run/search`, `cargo test`, `go test`, `ls`, `grep`, `git status`, etc. Interpreter wildcards (`python3`, `poetry run`) are allowed because a permission `allow` only skips the *prompt* — the PreToolUse guards still run, and `interpreter-guard` inspects inline `-c`/`-e`/heredoc code even when wrapped in a runner (`poetry run python -c …`). `gh api` and `kubectl` are both allowlisted, but they are not equally safe. `kubectl` is covered by `kubectl-guard`, which denies every mutating verb wherever it sits in the command. `gh api` has **no** equivalent coverage — it can POST/DELETE through the GitHub API and `network-guard` never inspects it, so that entry is a deliberate convenience trade rather than a guarded one. With the OS sandbox off, an auto-approved `python3 script.py` runs the script's contents unscanned — enable the sandbox for containment. |
| `permissions.deny` | `git push --force`, `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `gh auth token`, … | Deny always wins over allow |

## Auto mode

The harness ships `permissions.defaultMode: "auto"`. Instead of stopping for a
keystroke on every unrecognised action, a model classifier approves or denies
the prompt; read-only work (reading files, searching code) doesn't go to the
classifier at all. Verify the mode with `/status`, or override per session with
`claude --permission-mode manual`.

**This pins auto mode rather than enabling it.** As of Claude Code 2.1.227 auto
*is* the product default: `--permission-mode` accepts
`acceptEdits | auto | bypassPermissions | manual | dontAsk | plan` with no
`default` in the list, and a settings value of `"default"` means "whatever the
product default is" — which is now auto. So a machine sitting on `"default"`
already gets the classifier; setting `"auto"` explicitly just states the intent
and stops it drifting if that default changes again. The real opt-out is
`"manual"`.

**It only works in user settings.** Claude Code will not let a repo-level
`.claude/settings.json` grant `defaultMode: auto`, and the ignored value
*shadows* your user-level mode — so don't copy this harness's `settings.json`
into a project. The installer writes `~/.claude/settings.json`, which is the
right place. `install.sh` owns this key: an existing `defaultMode` is replaced
(with a notice) rather than winning the merge, so re-running the installer
actually flips an older install onto auto.

**What this changes about the guards:**

- **The `deny` tier is unaffected.** PreToolUse hooks run before the permission
  system, so a guard that denies still blocks the call in any mode.
- **The `ask` tier is no longer a question to you.** Everything the guards
  escalate as *ask* — `git push --delete`, `curl -X POST`, `scp` to a remote
  host, long inline interpreter scripts — is now adjudicated by the classifier
  on your behalf. Treat the ask rows in the tables above as "someone else
  decides", and promote anything you want stopped unconditionally into
  `permissions.deny` or `autoMode.hard_deny`.
- **Some `permissions.allow` entries are disregarded.** Auto mode ignores allow
  entries it classes as classifier-bypassing, so a broad wildcard may not buy
  you the silence it used to. Run `/doctor` inside a session to list which of
  your entries it's ignoring.

**Tuning the classifier.** Auto mode reads its rules from a top-level
`autoMode` key — `{environment, allow, soft_deny, hard_deny}`:

```bash
claude auto-mode defaults   # the shipped rules (17 allow, 65 soft_deny, 1 hard_deny, 20 environment)
claude auto-mode config     # the effective rules: yours where set, defaults otherwise
claude auto-mode critique   # AI review of your custom rules
claude auto-mode reset      # drop your autoMode section, back to shipped defaults
```

**The harness deliberately ships no `autoMode` block.** `auto-mode config`
describes the resolution as *"your settings where set, defaults otherwise"* —
i.e. setting a category looks like it **replaces** the shipped rules for that
category, not adds to them. Shipping a handful of `soft_deny` rules could
therefore silently drop the 65 that come with Claude Code, which is a bad trade
for a security harness. Write your own rules if you want them, then confirm
what survived with `claude auto-mode config` before trusting it.

## Repo layout

Two entry points sit at the root; everything else is grouped by what it is.

```
install.sh               ← run once per machine
doctor.sh                ← run every suite in tests/
bin/                     ← executables the harness installs or you invoke
  statusline.sh
  memory-verify.sh       ← memory staleness check (see Memory staleness)
  upstream-check.sh      ← scheduled drift guard (see Upstream drift)
  session-route.sh       ← which session owns this PR? (see docs/session-routing.md)
config/
  settings.json          ← the settings the installer merges in
  merge-settings.jq      ← how that merge is performed
  upstream-contract.json ← the upstream facts the harness relies on
hooks/                   ← one file per hook, plus shared lib.sh
skills/                  ← agent skills, one directory each
tests/                   ← one <name>.test.sh per hook or script
docs/                    ← research notes
  session-routing.md     ← routing a PR to the session that owns it; read the
                           precondition — it only holds in single-author repos
```

Paths inside `~/.claude` after install are flat — the grouping above is for
reading the repo, not for the installed tree.

## Testing the harness

```bash
bash doctor.sh
```

Runs every test in `tests/*.test.sh` and prints a summary. The full suite covers 530+ cases across all hooks, including known bypass attempts (symlinked dotfiles, quoted paths, commit messages containing trigger strings, `git -c`/`-C` global-option prefixes, shell-body git aliases, interpreter inline-code escapes and heredocs, combined interpreter flags, `@file` upload variants, stage-then-exfil copies, and mutating HTTP methods), a **fail-closed** check that every Bash/file guard denies when jq is unavailable, the plan-renderer (UTF-8 round-trip, script-injection containment, retention cap), and the settings merge (`config/merge-settings.jq` — that a stale `defaultMode` is replaced, allow/deny lists are unioned, user keys survive, and re-running the installer is a no-op).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `doctor.sh` on both Linux and macOS and lints every hook with `shellcheck` on each push and PR.

## Keeping up with Claude Code

This harness hard-codes facts about Claude Code — which hook events exist, which
permission modes are valid, what `settings.json` may contain. Claude Code
**auto-updates**, so those facts rot with no commit landing here. That has already
happened twice: auto mode became the product default, and `SessionEnd` appeared
while the session summary was still wired to `Stop`.

A push-triggered CI run can never catch this, because upstream changes when the
repo stands still. So:

```bash
bash bin/upstream-check.sh
```

`bin/upstream-check.sh` compares the harness against the **installed** CLI, using only
auth-free commands (`claude doctor`, `claude --version`) so CI needs no credentials.
It checks that the shipped `settings.json` still validates, that every hook event
the harness registers still exists, and that the shipped `defaultMode` is still
accepted — then reports events upstream has that nobody here has assessed.

It works by asking the CLI an impossible question: `claude doctor` prints the full
list of valid hook events *only* inside the warning for an unknown one, so the
check registers a sentinel event to make it enumerate them. Note that doctor
**exits 0 even when it rejects your settings**, so the output is parsed rather than
trusted.

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | contract holds | none |
| 1 | **breakage** — the harness relies on something upstream changed | fix the harness |
| 2 | upstream grew — new capability nobody has assessed | adopt it, or record the decision |
| 3 | the check itself could not run | install `jq` / the CLI |

`upstream-contract.json` holds the assumptions. `acknowledged_hook_events` is *not*
"events we use" — it is "events a human has looked at and decided about", and
`notes_on_unused_events` records why each unused one was skipped. When upstream adds
an event the check fails with exit 2 until someone either hooks it or writes down
why not. **That deliberate nag is the mechanism that keeps this harness current
instead of quietly stale.**

`.github/workflows/upstream-drift.yml` runs it **weekly on a schedule** plus on
demand, and on any push touching the assumptions. It installs the CLI via npm
rather than `curl … | bash` — piping a remote script into a shell is exactly what
this harness's own `network-guard` denies.

## Customization

**Extend the network allowlist per-project:**
```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_NET_ALLOWLIST": "internal.example.com api.myservice.io" } }
```

**Point the audit log elsewhere:**
```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_AUDIT_LOG": "~/logs/claude.log" } }
```

**Change where rendered plans are written:**
```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_PLANS_HTML_DIR": "~/Desktop/claude-plans" } }
```

**Render plans without auto-opening a browser** (e.g. headless / remote sessions):
```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_PLAN_HTML_NO_OPEN": "1" } }
```

**Open workflow scripts in a specific editor** (the status-line `wf` link). Auto-detects VS Code/Cursor/Zed; override the URI scheme:
```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_EDITOR_URI": "cursor://file" } }
```

**Enable the OS sandbox** (drafted off-by-default with a read-only allowlist). Flip it on globally in `~/.claude/settings.json`, or per-project in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{ "sandbox": { "enabled": true } }
```
Extend its allowlist under `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`.

## Known limitations

These guards are defense-in-depth, not a security boundary. Be clear-eyed about what they do **not** cover:

- **Regex guards have a ceiling.** Command-string matching can always be evaded by a determined agent (string-obfuscated interpreter payloads, novel tool invocations, multi-step stage-then-exfil across separate commands). The guards raise the bar and catch the obvious/accidental cases; the **OS sandbox** is the only real containment for the evasion class — see *Enable the OS sandbox*.
- **Auto mode removes you from the loop on the `ask` tier.** With `defaultMode: auto` the classifier resolves the prompts a human used to see. That is the point of the mode, but it means the guards' *ask* rules are advice to a model rather than a stop sign — see [Auto mode](#auto-mode). Set `defaultMode` to `manual` if you want every one of them back in your hands.
- **MCP connectors are not covered.** `network-guard` sees Bash `curl`/`wget` and the `WebFetch` tool, but MCP tools (Slack, Google Drive, Atlassian, …) can read files and send data outbound with no guard in the middle. Control that surface by only connecting MCP servers you trust.
- **Guards fail *closed* without jq**, so a missing-jq machine blocks all Bash/file tool calls rather than allowing them unchecked. Keep `jq` installed (the installer checks for it).

## Per-project additions (not in this harness)

Each repo manages its own:
- `CLAUDE.md` — PR format, reviewer names, workflow rules
- `.claude/settings.json` — project-specific deny rules, auto-formatter, test runner
- Slack notifications — via MCP connector, instructed through CLAUDE.md

## Memory staleness

Claude Code stores memories under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, and ships
its own hygiene pass (auto-dream) that merges duplicates, resolves
contradictions, and rewrites relative dates. That pass reasons over memory
content and session logs — it never leaves the machine.

So one failure mode survives it: a memory whose claim was overtaken by the
outside world. *"Draft PR #4821, held, land only if…"* stays internally
consistent forever, while the PR merged two months ago. Nothing in the file
disagrees; GitHub does.

`memory-verify.sh` closes that gap, and `/memory-audit` handles the half that
needs judgment.

```bash
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh                    # every store
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh --store <slug>     # one store
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh --json             # for the skill
```

Exit codes: `0` nothing to do · `1` something is provably stale · `2` needs
triage · `3` could not run.

A memory becomes mechanically checkable by carrying a `verify:` block:

```yaml
verify:
  - gh acme/api#4821 merged
  - jira PROJ-123 Done
```

Anything with a block is resolved directly against GitHub. Anything without one
is reported as `TRIAGE` — because real memories cite bare `#4821` rather than
`owner/repo#4821`, and often cite twenty of them, so choosing *which* reference
is the claim under test needs a model. That is `/memory-audit`: it resolves the
ambiguous ones, proposes corrections, and writes a `verify:` block back, so each
audited memory is mechanical from then on.

`MEMORY.md` itself is checked too, reported as `MEMORY.md:<line>` and aged by
the memory each line links to. The index is skipped as a *memory* — it is a list
of links, so it gets no `verify:` resolution — but its one-liners are prose that
goes stale like any other, and the index is the part loaded into context every
session. A stale hook there is read far more often than the memory behind it.

The script is read-only by contract — it never edits, moves, or deletes a
memory, and `/memory-audit` proposes rather than deletes. Deleting on a
heuristic destroys knowledge silently, which is worse than staleness.

**Note:** auto-dream is gated behind a server-side rollout flag
(`tengu_onyx_plover`). Where it is off, the built-in hygiene described above is
not running at all — check `/memory` to see whether it is available to you.
