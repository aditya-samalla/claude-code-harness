# Answers "who wrote this memory, and when?" — and the question that matters
# more: "which memories did THIS session write?"
#
# A memory file records what is believed, never who came to believe it. There is
# no author field in the body and no per-section date, so a paragraph a peer
# session appended twenty minutes ago is textually indistinguishable from one
# that has survived months of contact. With several sessions running, they all
# write to the store they all read from.
#
# That is a different defect from staleness, and worse in one specific way.
# Staleness means a memory was true once and aged out. This means a memory may
# never have been independently established at all — and it can manufacture
# agreement. The failure it produces: a session reports a finding, you check the
# store, the store agrees, and you report a claim as corroborated from two
# directions. It was one direction. That session wrote the memory an hour
# earlier, and before its edit the memory said the opposite. Two sources that
# are one source is worse than one source, because it licenses a confidence
# nothing earned.
#
# The data to prevent that is already on disk and simply never surfaced:
#
#   <store>/*.md                  metadata.originSessionId, metadata.modified
#   ~/.claude/jobs/*/state.json   sessionId -> the session's name
#
# So `--session "<name>"` answers, before you cite anything: did the session
# that just told me this also write the memory I am about to cite as agreement?
#
# Read-only by contract: reads memories and job records, writes nothing, and
# makes no network call.
#
# Usage:  bash memory-provenance.sh [--store SLUG] [--session NAME] [--anon] [--json]
#   --store SLUG    only this store (default: every store under ~/.claude/projects)
#   --session NAME  only memories written by sessions whose name contains NAME —
#                   the corroboration check
#   --anon          only memories that cannot be attributed at all
#   --json          one JSON object per memory
#
# Findings:
#   BY          attributed to a named session
#   UNRESOLVED  carries an originSessionId with no matching job record — written
#               from an interactive session, or the record aged out. Still a real
#               id, so two memories sharing it still share an author.
#   ANON        no originSessionId. Cannot be attributed, and cannot be excluded
#               as a source. Treat as unverified provenance, not as neutral.
#   DERIVED     attributed, but the origin was RECOVERED from transcripts by
#               memory-fix --provenance rather than stamped at write time. It is
#               evidence, not a record: good enough to exclude a session as an
#               independent source, not good enough to assert one. DERIVED? is
#               the same, with no job record to resolve the name.
#
# The distinction is the point. A recovered origin that rendered as BY would turn
# an inference into a fact silently, which is the failure this tool was built to
# prevent, reproduced inside the tool itself.
