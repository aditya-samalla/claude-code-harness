# Checks file-based memories against external truth.
#
# Claude Code's own hygiene (auto-dream) reasons over memory *content* and
# session logs — it never leaves the machine. So a memory that says "PR #4821
# is a held draft" survives consolidation untouched, because nothing inside the
# file contradicts it. The contradiction lives on GitHub. That is the gap this
# closes.
#
# Two classes of memory, deliberately handled differently:
#
#   1. Carries a `verify:` block  -> resolved mechanically here, no model needed.
#   2. Does not                   -> reported as TRIAGE for the /memory-audit
#                                    skill, which has the judgment to work out
#                                    which repo a bare "#4821" means and then
#                                    writes a `verify:` block back, so the next
#                                    run lands in class 1.
#
# Read-only by contract: this script never edits, moves, or deletes a memory.
# Deleting on a heuristic destroys knowledge silently, which is strictly worse
# than staleness. It reports; a human or the skill decides.
#
# Usage:  bash memory-verify.sh [--store SLUG] [--json] [--all]
#   --store SLUG  only this store (default: every store under ~/.claude/projects)
#   --json        one JSON object per finding, for the skill to consume
#   --all         also list VERIFIED memories (default: only what needs attention)
#   --curate      also propose retirement + merge candidates (advisory, never deletes)
#
# The index has TWO limits and the line one usually binds first: 200 lines and
# ~25,000 characters. One line per memory means a store with more than ~200
# memories cannot comply by shortening hooks — only by consolidating them.
#
# Exit: 0 nothing needs attention · 1 at least one STALE · 2 only TRIAGE/SKIP
#       3 could not run
#
# Portability: macOS ships bash 3.2 — no associative arrays, no mapfile.

# There is deliberately NO "retire this memory" heuristic here, and the reason
# is worth recording so the idea is not re-invented. Staleness is not the test:
# an audit of a real 204-memory store found four verifiably stale memories and
# zero deletable ones, because in every case the lesson outlived the ticket.
# The obvious fallback — "settled outcome AND no lesson-shaped wording" — was
# built and then removed: it flagged a memory recording a verified pipeline
# MISMATCH and another recording that a table is absent from the lakehouse, so
# a conversion is blocked. Both are durable FACTS carrying no lesson-shaped
# words. No wordlist separates a pure status record from a durable fact, and a
# wrong suggestion here costs knowledge that cannot be recovered. Retirement
# stays a human judgement; this script only surfaces size pressure and overlap.

# The index is skipped as a memory (it is a list of links, not a claim), which
# left a blind spot: a stale claim written into an index one-liner was never
# examined at all — and the index is the part loaded into context every single
# session, so it is the worst place to leave one. Found in a real store, where a
# hook still said "awaiting new doc dump" for work that had merged months
# earlier while the memory it pointed at was already correct.
#
# Age-gate each line by the memory it links to, not by the index's own mtime:
# the index is rewritten whenever any entry changes, so its mtime says nothing
