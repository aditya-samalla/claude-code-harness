# Detects when Claude Code has drifted away from what this harness assumes.
#
# The harness hard-codes upstream facts: which hook events exist, which
# permission modes are valid, what the CLI accepts in settings.json. Claude Code
# auto-updates and those facts move. A push-triggered CI run can never catch it,
# because upstream changes when this repo does not — so this is built to run on a
# schedule (.github/workflows/upstream-drift.yml) and to fail loudly when reality
# and upstream-contract.json disagree.
#
# Auth-free by design: `claude doctor` and `claude --version` need no login, so
# CI runs them without credentials.
#
# Usage:  bash upstream-check.sh
# Exit:   0 contract holds · 1 BREAKAGE · 2 upstream grew (needs acknowledging)
#         3 could not run the checks
#
# Testing seam: CLAUDE_DOCTOR_CMD overrides how doctor is invoked so
# tests/upstream-check.test.sh can feed canned output with no CLI installed.
#
# Portability: no mapfile/associative arrays — macOS ships bash 3.2.
