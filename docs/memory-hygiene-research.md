# Research addendum: what Claude Code already does about memory hygiene

Written 2026-08-11 against Claude Code **2.1.227**. It began as an addendum to a local working
document (a hand audit of the live memory stores, not included here because it quotes internal
work), whose premise was that file-based memory is "garbage-collected by nobody". That premise is
**not accurate**: Claude Code ships a memory-hygiene mechanism today, and the question is whether it
is enabled for you. Re-scope before building anything.

Claims below were checked against the shipped binary, live settings, and live store contents, or
read from the cited source. Where something is inferred rather than observed, it says so.

## Errata — verified against 2.1.228 on 2026-08-12

Two claims below were re-checked and did not hold. Both are left in place so the reasoning is
readable, but read them with these corrections:

- **§1 "most of it is simply not enabled" understates it.** Auto Dream is gated on the
  `tengu_onyx_plover` GrowthBook flag, and the check short-circuits *before* the `autoDreamEnabled`
  setting is read (`if (!available) return false`). Where the flag is off there is **no toggle to
  turn on** — the `/memory` row is hidden and the setting is inert. The recommendation to "open
  /memory and enable it" is therefore not always actionable.
- **§2's ~200-line index cap: CORRECTED 2026-08-27, it is real.** This entry previously read
  "unsubstantiated — no such line limit was found in 2.1.228", and that finding was wrong. It came
  from searching for a constant rather than for the comparison that uses one. In 2.1.250 the index
  loader destructures `{trimmed, lineCount, byteCount}` and tests `lineCount > 200` and
  `byteCount > 25000`; truncation is line-first (`split("\n").slice(0, 200)`) and then clamped to
  the byte limit, so passing line 200 drops everything after it. The size limit is **bytes** — the
  identifier is literally `byteCount` — which is why the harness reports bytes, not characters.
  `bin/upstream-check.sh` section 4d now re-reads both numbers from the CLI on every run, resolving
  the minified identifiers from the expression so a rename moves the check with the code.
  Token budget is a *separate* constraint, and the `/context` advisory (above both 5% of context and
  5000 tokens) measures that one, not this.

  Worth keeping as a method note: two readings of this codebase were unverified in opposite
  directions at the same time — this doc called the limit folklore while `memory-verify` and
  `memory-lint` enforced 200 as fact, and neither side had read the comparison. A grep for a value
  cannot see a threshold; only the comparison can.

Also worth separating: `tengu_memory_threshold_crossed` is a Node process RAM monitor, unrelated to
the memory store, and should not be read as a store-size nudge.

## 1. What Claude Code already ships

| Feature | Evidence | Bears on |
|---|---|---|
| **`/memory`** — "Use /memory to view and manage Claude memory". Also where Auto Dream is toggled and shared-memory projects are picked. | binary strings | all |
| **Threshold nudge** — `tengu_memory_threshold_crossed` → "Use /memory to review and prune stale entries." | binary strings | brief §1 (the "size-hook nag" is **built-in**, not the harness's) |
| **Age warning on recall** — the `N days old` system-reminder the brief describes. | binary strings + brief | mode 1 |
| **Auto Dream / background memory consolidation** — setting `autoDreamEnabled`: *"Enable background memory consolidation (auto-dream). When set, overrides the server-side default."* | binary strings | modes 2, 4, 5 |
| **Shared / team / org memory** with a server-side sync layer | binary strings | mode 5 |
| **`CLAUDE_MEMORY_STORES`** env var | binary strings | §4 fragmentation, Q5 |

### Auto Dream, in detail — this is the big one

Observed in the shipped binary:

- Runs as a **constrained agent**, not a heuristic. Its own prompt says: *"Shell access is restricted
  to read-only commands (`ls`, `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `stat`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, and similar) plus
  deleting `.md` files inside the memory directory (outside protected subdirectories like `.git` or
  `agents`; `rm` takes no flags except `-f`). Anything else that writes, redirects to a file, or
  modifies state will be denied."*
- **Has the locking the brief says is missing**: `.consolidate-lock`, plus `[autoDream] lock held by
  live PID`, `lock acquire failed`, and `rollback failed` paths.
- **Triggered by session count**, not size: `Sessions since last consolidation (N)` / `N sessions
  since last consolidation, need M`.
- **Phased**, with a `## Phase 3 — Consolidate` step and `dream-proposal` / `DreamTask` machinery.
- Per public write-ups it merges memories, deletes contradicting facts, and **converts relative dates
  to absolute** — i.e. it already covers mode 2.
- Carries an explicit CLAUDE.md rule: *"do NOT edit CLAUDE.md during a dream. Annotate the memory with
  'contradicts CLAUDE.md — verify which is current'"*.

**State on this machine:** `autoDreamEnabled` is **absent** from `~/.claude/settings.json`, and there
are **no** `*dream*` / `*consolidat*` state files anywhere under `~/.claude`. So either the server-side
default is off, or it has never run here. **Check `/memory` first — it may be one toggle.**

### Shared memory already solves mode 5 server-side

Verbatim strings from the binary:

- *"was NOT saved to shared memory: another session updated the file first (concurrent-write conflict).
  The file on disk has been refreshed with the server's current version. Re-read it and re-apply your
  change if it is still wanted."*
- A **mass-deletion guard**: *"N synced memory files went missing from this session's disk at once,
  which almost always means the local memory folder was wiped rather than deliberately cleared…
  If you really do intend to remove that many memories, delete them in smaller batches."*
- **Secret scanning on memory writes**: content that looks sensitive *"cannot be written to team
  memory. Team memory is shared with all repository collaborators."*

Mode 5 is therefore **solved for synced stores** and **unsolved only for purely local ones**. Any
harness locking scheme must not fight auto-dream's `.consolidate-lock`.

## 2. A sixth failure mode the brief doesn't have

**Index overflow → silent non-recall.** Claude loads only **~200 lines** of `MEMORY.md` at session
start; lines past that are dropped with no warning. Same end state as mode 3 (orphan): the fact exists
on disk and is never recalled — but caused by index *length*, not absence from the index. Source:
`alexknowshtml/claude-memory-health`, which demotes at a default of **100** lines for this reason.

**Live headroom on this machine** (index lines vs. sibling files):

```
 84  84   <store-a>    <- largest; leading indicator
 26  27   <store-b>    <- 1 unindexed file (a known orphan)
 25  22   <store-c>
  6   6   <store-d>
  4   4   <store-e>
  4   4   <store-f>
  2   2   <store-g>
  1   1   <store-h>    <- this repo
```

Not yet a live problem — but it caps how far "just keep appending one-liners" scales, and it makes an
index-length check cheap and worth having. Store topology otherwise **confirms the brief**: 8 stores,
158 `.md` files. (Note a 9th slug appears for a *git worktree* of this repo — the worktree path is
sanitized into its own slug — so worktrees fragment stores further.)

## 3. Prior art in the wild

| Project | Shape | Checks | Deletes? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`alexknowshtml/claude-memory-health`](https://github.com/alexknowshtml/claude-memory-health) | `/memory-health` slash command + TS scripts (`check-bloat.ts`, `check-orphans.ts`) + optional cron scheduler running `claude` headless | size bloat (>100 lines), orphans, inline content that should be extracted, staleness | **No** — demotes to `cold-storage/` |
| [`dgowrie/claude-workflows` → `skills/memory-audit`](https://github.com/dgowrie/claude-workflows/blob/main/skills/memory-audit/SKILL.md) | skill; discover → read index → evaluate → report → apply | >30 days & no ongoing relevance; files >2KB; relative dates → absolute (anchored on mtime); redundancy; cross-project promotion to global `CLAUDE.md` | **No** — proposes, user confirms |

Converging conventions worth adopting:

1. **Nobody auto-deletes.** Both tools demote or propose. This **matches the brief's non-negotiable**
   — and notably *diverges from Auto Dream*, which does delete (with a model in the loop, a lock, and
   rollback). So "just enable Auto Dream" is **not** a full substitute for the brief's intent; that is
   a real, informed disagreement to make deliberately rather than by accident.
2. **Hot/cold split** — `MEMORY.md` + sibling one-liners for behavioural rules; `cold-storage/` for
   domain detail loaded on demand. These stores already follow the spirit of it.
3. **Slash command / skill, not a hook**, for anything needing judgment. Cron + headless `claude` for
   the unattended pass. Matches the brief's Q1 instinct exactly.
4. **Absolute dates always** — relative dates are treated as a defect to be rewritten.

---

## 4. Revised recommendation

**Do first, before writing code (zero effort):** open `/memory`, see whether Auto Dream is available
and off, and turn it on for one cycle. Measure what it fixes in the 84-file store. Everything below is
scoped by that result.

**Don't build** — shipped or covered by prior art: consolidation/merging, relative→absolute date
rewriting, dedup, locking for *synced* stores, mass-delete protection, secret-scanning memory writes.

**Do build — the genuine gaps, in value order:**

1. **Mode 1, external-claim verification.** Nothing — built-in or community — checks a memory against
   *external truth*. Auto Dream reasons over memory content and session logs; both community tools flag
   staleness by **age**, not by fact. The brief's `verify: {gh: acme/api#4821}` frontmatter
   idea is genuinely novel and remains the **highest-leverage** item. Both proven-false memories were
   one `gh pr view` away. The brief's caveat stands: it only helps memories written *after* the
   convention exists, and the writing convention lives in Anthropic's system prompt — but the harness
   *can* inject the convention via `SessionStart` stdout or `CLAUDE.md`, which is the lever that makes
   it viable without Anthropic changing anything.
2. **Mode 3 + index parity + index length.** Purely mechanical set-difference plus a line count against
   the ~200 cap. Cheap, no model, correct home for a hook. Print only when something is wrong (the
   brief's context-budget constraint, and the resume-drift precedent).
3. **Mode 5 for local-only stores**, as a `PreToolUse` invariant on `MEMORY.md` (entry count must not
   decrease silently) — *if* auto-dream's lock doesn't already cover the observed clobber. Re-verify the
   original clobber against `.consolidate-lock` behaviour before building.
4. **Store fragmentation (Q5)** — investigate `CLAUDE_MEMORY_STORES` before designing symlink/merge
   schemes; it may be the supported answer. Worktrees make this worse (see the 9th slug above).

**Open question this addendum adds:** is enabling **team/shared memory** preferable to building local
locking? It moves mode 5, mass-delete protection, and secret-scanning onto the server — at the cost of
sending memory contents to a shared store, which is a judgment call for work material and must not be
made unilaterally.
