# still in flight, with no `verify:` block, can never be checked at all.

# repeated forever: a corpus of 218 memories accumulated 64 name mismatches, 26
# broken links and 88 missing timestamps, and a memory written by the live
# system DURING the session that fixed all of them arrived with no timestamp and
# a 176-character index hook.
#
# Advisory by design. This is a PostToolUse hook, so the write has already
# happened; the findings go back to the model while the context is still hot and
# the fix costs one edit. It never blocks and never edits.
