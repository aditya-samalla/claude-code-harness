description: Check stored memories against external truth (GitHub PRs, Jira issues) and propose corrections for the ones reality has overtaken. Use when asked to audit/clean up memory, when a memory's claim about a PR or ticket looks out of date, when memory-verify.sh reports STALE or TRIAGE, or before trusting an old project memory that asserts something is still in flight.

# Auditing memories against external truth

Claude Code's built-in memory hygiene reasons over memory *content* and session
logs. It never leaves the machine. So a memory saying "PR #4821 is a held
draft" survives consolidation intact — nothing inside the file contradicts it.
The contradiction lives on GitHub. Closing that gap needs an external lookup,
and working out *which* lookup needs judgment. That is this skill's job.

## The hard part, and why a script cannot do it alone

`memory-verify.sh` (installed at `~/.claude/memory-verify.sh`) resolves any
memory carrying a `verify:` block. Most memories do not carry one, and their
references are genuinely ambiguous:

- References are usually bare — `#4821`, not `acme/api#4821`. The same number
  exists in every repo.
- A single memory often cites many references — twenty or more is common for a
  long-running piece of work. Only one or two are *the claim under test*; the
  rest are supporting detail.
- Memories frequently name several repositories, or none at all, so the file
  itself may not tell you which repo a given number belongs to.

So your value here is picking the operative claim and resolving the reference.
Once you have, you write a `verify:` block back into the file — and that memory
becomes mechanically checkable forever after. **The audit is not just a cleanup;
it is how the corpus becomes self-checking.** Prefer leaving a `verify:` block
behind on every file you touch, even one you conclude is still accurate.

## Procedure

**1. Collect findings.**

```bash
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh --json                  # every store
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh --json --store <slug>   # one store
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh --store <slug> --curate  # + index size and merge candidates
```

If that path does not exist, the harness is not installed on this machine; fall
back to `memory-verify.sh` in a checkout of the harness repo.

Each line is `{status, store, file, detail}`. Handle by status:

- `STALE` — already proven wrong. Go straight to step 3.
- `TRIAGE` — no `verify:` block; needs steps 2 and 3.
- `SKIP` — could not be resolved mechanically. Issue-tracker claims land here
  because trackers are reachable only over MCP, not from a shell script;
  resolve those with whichever tracker MCP is connected.
- `VERIFIED` — nothing to do.
- `OVERSIZE` — the store's index is past a load limit; see step 6.
- `CANDIDATE` — advisory, `--curate` only: two memories about one ticket.

**2. Work out what the memory actually claims.**

Read the whole file. Then:

- **Find the operative claim** — the sentence asserting current state ("held",
  "PENDING", "awaiting review", "not yet deployed"). Supporting references that
  merely explain history are not claims to verify.
- **Resolve the reference to a repo.** Use repo names in the file's own text
  first. If the file names several, match each reference to the repo discussed
  in its own paragraph.
- **Confirm the match before trusting it.** Fetch the title and compare it to
  what the memory describes:
  ```bash
  gh pr view <num> --repo <owner/repo> --json state,title,mergedAt
  ```
  If the title has nothing to do with the memory's subject, you resolved to the
  wrong repo. A confidently wrong `verify:` block is worse than none, because
  every later run trusts it.
- **If you cannot resolve it, stop and ask.** Do not guess a repo from the
  number's magnitude alone.

**3. Report, and propose an edit. Never delete on your own initiative.**

A memory is only safe to touch *after* an external check has confirmed what it
claims is false. Deleting on a heuristic destroys knowledge silently, which is
worse than staleness. Propose; let the user decide.

For each affected memory, show:

- what the memory claims, quoted;
- what the lookup returned, with the date (`merged 2026-06-15`);
- the proposed edit.

Prefer the smallest correct edit:

- **Claim overtaken** — rewrite the claim to what is now true and keep the
  history. `PENDING: merge, deploy, live-verify` becomes
  `Merged 2026-06-15 and verified in prod.`
- **Self-contradiction** — the file asserts both open and closed state because
  an update was appended without revising the original. Delete the superseded
  sentence, keep the current one.
- **Whole memory now worthless** — say so and recommend deletion, but let the
  user confirm. If the memory records a *lesson* rather than a status, the
  lesson usually outlives the ticket: keep it, fix the status line.

**4. Leave a `verify:` block behind.**

Add near the top of the body, after the frontmatter:

```yaml
verify:
  - gh acme/api#4821 merged
  - jira PROJ-123 Done
```

Format is `<kind> <ref> <expected-state>`, one claim per line:

- `gh` — ref must be `owner/repo#number`; expected is `merged`, `open`, or
  `closed`. Works for issues too.
- `jira` — ref is the issue key; expected is the status name. Resolved by this
  skill via MCP, not by the script.

Record what you expect to *stay* true. `merged` is stable; `open` will go stale
by design — which is the point, since that is the claim worth re-checking.

**5. Keep the index honest.** If you rename or delete a memory, update the
matching `- [Title](file.md) — hook` line in that store's `MEMORY.md`.

`memory-verify.sh` reports index lines as `MEMORY.md:<line>`, aged by the memory
they link to. Treat those exactly like any other finding — resolve the claim,
then rewrite the one-liner. They matter more than their size suggests: the index
is the part loaded into context every session, so a stale hook there is read far
more often than the memory behind it, and the two can disagree. A real store had
a hook saying a PR was a draft awaiting validation while the memory it pointed
at already recorded that PR as merged and validated.

The index gets no `verify:` block of its own — put that on the memory it links
to, and keep the hook consistent with it.


**6. Check the index against its load limits.**

The index has two, and the line one usually binds first:

| | limit |
|---|---|
| lines | **200** |
| characters | **~25,000** |

Past either, the tail is dropped silently at session start — the oldest hooks
simply stop reaching the model, with no error where it is used. `memory-verify.sh`
reports this as `OVERSIZE` on every run, naming which limit and by how much.

**One line per memory means a store with more than ~200 memories cannot comply
by shortening hooks.** Trimming entry text buys headroom on the *character*
limit only. Getting under the line limit requires fewer entries, which means
consolidation — so `--curate` reports which memories are about the same ticket:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/memory-verify.sh --store <slug> --curate
```

Grouping is taken from each memory's `name`/`description`, not its body: a
ticket cited in prose is a reference, a ticket named in the description is what
the memory is *about*. Merging a group is an ordinary edit — fold the two
bodies into one file, keep both sets of lessons, delete the file that lost, and
update its index line per step 5. Confirm with the user first, as with any
deletion.

**Why there is no "retire this memory" suggestion.** It was built and removed.
Staleness is not the test: an audit of a real 204-memory store found four
verifiably stale memories and *zero* deletable ones, because in every case the
lesson outlived the ticket. The fallback test — settled outcome plus no
lesson-shaped wording — then flagged a memory recording a verified pipeline
mismatch, and another recording that a table is absent from the lakehouse so a
conversion is blocked. Both are durable facts that happen to contain no
lesson-shaped words. No wordlist separates a pure status record from a durable
fact, and a wrong suggestion costs knowledge that cannot be recovered. Deciding
what to retire stays yours.

## Rules

- **Never delete a memory without an external check confirming it is false**,
  and never without the user agreeing.
- **Never edit a memory you have not read in full.** The operative claim is
  often not the one the scanner flagged.
- **Absolute dates only.** Rewrite "last week" to the actual date.
- **Do not touch `CLAUDE.md`.** If a memory contradicts it, annotate the memory
  with `contradicts CLAUDE.md — verify which is current` and raise it.
- **Batch your questions.** Audit the set, then come back with one consolidated
  set of proposals rather than interrupting per file.

## Scope

Default to the store for the current project. Audit every store only when
asked — memory is siloed per launch directory, so the same repo can have two
stores, and a full sweep is a much larger job than it looks.
